Bot discord

This is an open source discord bot that let's you play music on your discord server. You just need to register a bot and feed this code the API key in order for it to work.
I also added a few commands that lets you manage a valheim server from the bot. Which is pretty useless since no one really plays that game anymore. Eventually most
of the info used by the bot (aka private static final variables) will be replaced by a database.

If you want to add custom commands it should be pretty easy for you if you know a bit how spring boot works. I'll be adding a better description once I clean up the code
a little bit. If you have any questions or want a certain modification, feel free to create an issue. Cheers :)
